\begin{itemize}

\item Statistics must have started as a state arithmetic to assist a rural who neeeded to know the wealth and numbers of other properties in order to levy tax.
\item Gambling as games of chance to the theory of probability about the middle of seventh century.
\item Statistical principles involve certain logical patterns, methods of reasoning and critical thinking. Using the logical reasoning we draw conclusions based on incomplete information about a phenomenon. The Theory of Probability is used for this purpose. Thus there is a linkage between probability theory and statistical principles.
\item A branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data (Merriam webster)
\item In statistics, a single value has no meaning. At least two observations must be needed for statistical analysis. The statistics deals with group of individuals -- populations -- not a single object.

\begin{block}{Definition}
Statistics can be defined as the body of concepts, examples and methods dealing with collection, summarization, analysis and interpretation of data. -- R. Rangaswamy, 1995 \\[0.5cm]
Statistics is the science, pure and applied, of developing and applying the techniques to deal with quantitative and qualitative information, such that uncertainity of inductive inference may be evaluatated. -- Steel and Torrie, 1960.

\begin{frame}{Branches of statistics}
\protect\hypertarget{branches-of-statistics}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Organizing and summarizing data is called \textbf{descriptive}
  statistics.
\item
  Two ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for
  example, finding an average).
\item
  After you have studied probability and probability distributions, you
  will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from ``good''data. The
  formal methods are called \textbf{inferential} statistics.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Historically, kings and chiefs of states were using statistics in
  framing suitable military and fiscal policies, imposing taxes and
  maintaining law and order for the welfare of state.
\item
  Vast governmental statistical activities are in operation for
  collection and dissemination of data such as national population
  census, economic affairs, national production, input-output accounts,
  balance payments, measures of past trends, current status and future
  projections.
\item
  These days statistical methodology is employed by investigators in
  virtually all disciplines, including such areas as:

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item business enterprises (production/purchase planning, marketing and quality control decision making)
  \item molecular biology (analysis of microarray data)
  \item ecology (describing quantitatively how individuals in various animal and plant populations are spatially distributed)
  \item materials engineering (studying properties of various treatments to retard corrosion) marketing (developing market surveys and strategies for marketing new products)
  \item public health (identifying sources of diseases and ways to treat them) 
  \item civil engineering (assessing the effects of stress on structural elements and the impacts of traffic flows on communities)

\begin{frame}{Probability proportional to size sampling}
\protect\hypertarget{probability-proportional-to-size-sampling}{}
In probability proportional to size sampling the selection probability
for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure, up to a
maximum of 1.

Example: Suppose we have six schools with populations of 150, 180, 200,
220, 260, and 490 students respectively (total 1500 students), and we
want to use student population as the basis for a PPS sample of size
three. To do this, we could allocate the first school numbers 1 to 150,
the second school 151 to 330 (= 150 + 180), the third school 331 to 530,
and so on to the last school (1011 to 1500). We then generate a random
start between 1 and 500 (equal to 1500/3) and count through the school
populations by multiples of 500. If our random start was 137, we would
select the schools which have been allocated numbers 137, 637, and 1137,
i.e.~the first, fourth, and sixth schools.

The PPS approach can improve accuracy for a given sample size by
concentrating sample on large elements that have the greatest impact on
population estimates.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Stratified random sampling}
\protect\hypertarget{stratified-random-sampling}{}
When the population consists of two or more subpopulations, called
strata, a sampling plan that ensures that each subpopulation is
represented in the sample is called a \textbf{stratified} random sample.

National polls usually involve some form of stratified random sampling
with states as strata, and state polls involve sampling technique using
districts or municipalities as strata.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Systematic sampling}
\protect\hypertarget{systematic-sampling}{}
Sometimes the population to be sampled is ordered, such as an
alphabetized list of people with driver's licenses, a list of utility
users arranged by service addresses, or a list of customers by account
numbers. In these and other situations, one element is chosen at random
from the first k elements, and then every k-th element thereafter is
included in the sample. This comprises a \textbf{1-in-k systematic
random sample}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cluster sampling}
\protect\hypertarget{cluster-sampling}{}
When the available sampling units are group of elements, random sampling
performed on such units comprise a culstered sampling. For example, a
household is a cluster of individuals living together. When a particular
cluster is included in the sample, a census of every element in the
cluster is taken.

\protect\hypertarget{section-8}{}
An experiment with 30 indigenous and exotic collections/cultivars of
garden pea was conducted at Division of Vegetable crops, IARI, New Delhi
during 1998. There were approximately 300 plants per plot. The
characters observed were the day of appearance of first flower, first
flowering node number, length of internodes, the day of 50\% flowering,
the day of first green pod harvest, number of primary branches, the
length of pod, plant height, etc. It was not possible to take
observation on 300 plants for each character. For convenience, the
measurements were made only from 10 plants out of 300 plants in each of
the plots for characters mentioned above.

One may also count tiller numbers only 1 msq of the 15 msq plot, for
leaf area, measure from only 20 of the approximately 2000 leaves in the
plot, etc.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-9}{}
For \emph{plot sampling} (selection of some plants from a plot), number
of plants in each plot is a population. The character under study is
estimated from some selected plants. The selected plants are known as a
sample. An appropriate sample is one that provides an estimate, or a
sample value, that is as close as possible to the value that would have
been obtained had all plant in the plot been measured -- the plot value.
The difference between the sample value and the plot value constitutes
the sampling error.

To develop a plot sampling technique for measurement of a character in a
given trial, we must specify the sampling unit, the sample size, and the
sampling design.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-10}{}
The sampling unit is the unit on which actual measurement is made. Some
commonly used sampling units in a replicated field trial are a leaf, a
plant, a group of plants, a unit area etc.

The number of sampling units taken from the population is known as
sample size. The required sample size for a particular experiment is
governed by:

\begin{enumerate}
[i.]
\tightlist
\item
  The size of the variability among sampling units within the same plot
  (sampling variance).
\item
  The degree of precision desired for the character of interest.
\end{enumerate}

In practice, the size of the sampling variance for most plant characters
is generally not known. However, its value can be estimated or assumed
to be known. The desired level of precision can, however, be prescribed
by the researcher based on experimental objective and previous
experience, in terms of the marign of error, either of the plot mean or
of the treatment mean.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-11}{}
The sample size for a simple random sampling design that can satisfy a
prescribed margin of error of the plot mean is computed as:

\[
n = \frac{Z_{\alpha/2}^2 \times v_s}{d^2 \times \bar{X}^2}
\]

Where, n is the required sample size, \(Z_{\alpha/2}\) is the value of
the standardized normal variate corresponding to level of significance
\(\alpha\), \(v_s\) is the sampling variance, \(\bar{X}\) is the mean
value, and d is the margin of error expressed as a fraction of the plot
mean.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-12}{}
\footnotesize

The information of primary interest to the researcher is usually the
treatment means (the average over all plots receiving the same
treatment) or actually the difference of means, rather than plot mean
(the value from a single plot). Thus, the desired degree of precision is
usually specified in terms of the margin of error of the treatment mean
rather than that of the plot mean. In such a case, sample size is
computed as:

\[
n = \frac{Z_{\alpha/2}^2 v_s}{r D^2 \bar{X^2} - Z_{\alpha/2}^2 v_p}
\]

Where, n is the required sample size, r is the number of replications,
\(Z_{\alpha/2}\) and \(v_s\) are as defined earlier, \(v_p\) is the
variance between plots of the same treatment (i.e.~experimental error),
and D is the prescribed margin of error expressed as a fraction of the
treatment mean. In this case, additional information on the size of the
experimental error (\(v_p\)) is needed to compute the sample size.

A sampling design specifies the manner in which the \(n\) sampling units
are to be selected from the whole plot. Most commonly used sampling
designs in replicated field trials are detailed herein.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{General practices in sampling}
\protect\hypertarget{general-practices-in-sampling}{}
Precision of a sample estimate generally increases with the size of the
sampling unit, sample size, and the complexity of the sampling design
used. However, an increase in either the size or the number of sampling
units always increases the cost. Therefore, a proper balance has to be
maintained between the size of the sampling unit, sample size and a
sampling design on one hand and the cost at the other. This requires the
information on the variability of the character of interest so that the
precision that will result from the various types of sampling techniques
can be estimated. There are three sources of the data from which the
required information can be obtained: i. from previous trials, ii.
additional data from ongoing experiments, or iii. specifically planned
sampling studies.
